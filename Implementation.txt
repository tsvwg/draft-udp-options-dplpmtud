DPLPMTUD for UDP Options

This is a profile for implementing DPLPMTUD with a datagram transport. The base specification is RFC 8899, itself published as a PS.

Implementation Experience with DPLPMTUD and UDP Options
=======================================================

UDP for DPLPMTUD Options is a product of the IETF TSVWG working group. This is one profile for implementing DPLPMTUD with a datagram transport. The base specification is RFC 8899, published as PS. 

The I-D describes for two messages - RES and REQ, which are used to provide path probes for this algorithm. 

* Tom Jones reported an implementation in a fork of FreeBSD as the spec was being developed in TSVWG, at IETF 101, London with prototype support for FreeBSD, using RES/REQÂ exchanges, which at the time were proposed within UDP options. The wire format has not changed since.

It was also implemented in a scapy, which was used as a test suite during development (https://github.com/adventureloop/network-tests/tree/master/udpoptions).
